# Introduction to R

## Description

This site contains materials for introductory R courses I've develop and taught specifically tailored to certain audiences or venues (e.g., conferences). 

- [Intro to R: Pet names](intro_pet_names.md): two-hour overview of Tidyverse data analysis using data from [City of Seattle pet licenses](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Seattle-Pet-Licenses/jguv-t9rb). Designed and taught at [CascadiaRConf 2021](https://cascadiarconf.org).

## What to expect as a participant

If you are taking a workshop based on these materials,
you should prepare by:

- bringing a computer (laptop, not Google Chromebook or Microsoft Surface) on which to perform the living coding exercises
- software installed as described in the [installation instructions](software.md)
- ensuring your mindset is open to participating

## For instructors

If you are interested in using these materials for teaching,
