# Introduction to R

## Description

This site contains materials for introductory R courses I've develop and taught specifically tailored to certain audiences or venues (e.g., conferences). 

- **Intro to R: Pet names**: two-hour overview of Tidyverse data analysis using data from [City of Seattle pet licenses](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Seattle-Pet-Licenses/jguv-t9rb). Designed and taught at [CascadiaRConf 2021](https://cascadiarconf.org).

## What to expect as a participant

If you are taking a workshop based on these materials,
you should prepare by:

- bringing a computer (laptop, not Google Chromebook or Microsoft Surface) on which to perform the living coding exercises
- software (R, RStudio, Tidyverse) installed as described in the [installation instructions](software.md) (note: if you have previously installed this software, you may find it useful to upgrade to the latest versions)
- ensuring your mindset is open to participating

Answers to questions commonly asked by people getting started with R are available in the [FAQs](faqs.md).

## For instructors

If you are interested in using these materials for teaching,
