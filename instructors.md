# Instructors

- Please see [this page](https://github.com/fredhutchio/instructors) for general guidelines for teaching these materials. Additional recommendations specific for this course can be found below.
- You may choose to share your script to Dropbox to help folks stay on track. If you create the project in Dropbox, you can copy the link to each class script and share with the class. Files ending in `.R` are rendered as text in a browser window, but learners will need to refresh the screen to see updates.
- Administering challenges: Typing the challenge exercise into the script as a comment is usually easiest. Some challenges that include a chunk of code may be copied from Dropbox if you're sharing your script, or you can paste it into the chat feature of your videoconferencing system or interactive webpage (HackMD) for an in-person session. 
- Answers to frequently asked questions, as well as additional resources for learning, are available in the [faqs](faqs.md) page.
